                            BeingReal is led by a founder with direct, on-ground experience in financial operations,
                            internal controls, and business support systems, developed through responsibility held across
                            retail and service environments in the UAE and India.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The work has involved managing financial discipline at the operational level&mdash;including
                            payroll cycles, reconciliations, inventory oversight, and expense governance&mdash;where
                            accuracy, consistency, and trust are non-negotiable.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Alongside professional practice, the founder is pursuing a formal education in commerce,
                            ensuring that practical execution is supported by a strong theoretical foundation.
